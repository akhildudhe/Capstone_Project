### Objectives of this project to build Machine Learning Model to predict the happenings in Auto Insurance Industry with<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/auto-insurance-fall-2017/data"> Kaggle dataset</a> with following methodologies:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis[EDA]. 
2. Machine-Learning Modelling.
-----------------------------
### Objective Perspective to gain:  

1. Analysis on Conquering Market Share.
2. Analysis on Risk Management.
3. Analysis on Smooth Processing.
4. Analysis on Increased Profits.

-----------------------------

### Exploratory Data Analysis[EDA]:
<ul>
    <li>Aims at advanced analytics initially by cleaning the data and create different forms of graph on it.</li>
    <li>Also preparing data ready for Machine-Learning Modelling.</li>
</ul>

### Machine-Learning Modelling:
<ul>
    <li>Aims at training Machine-Models with different types of Alogrithm with respective tuning parameters.</li>
    <li>Also aims at final analysis of all the Algorithm to select which among them is best suit for data provided.</li>
</ul>

--------------------------------
